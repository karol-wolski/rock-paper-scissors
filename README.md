# Rock - Paper - Scissors

This project is a simple game known as Rock - Paper - Scissors. 
Currently, the player has the option to play against the computer. 
In the future, I want to add two more game modes such as play with a friend and play with a random opponent. 
The project was made using HTML, SCSS and TypeScript.
